## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a **unified pipeline** to test LLMs' ability to solve graph algorithm problems. It supports a comprehensive coverage of **graph tasks**, **prompting strategies**, and **graph representations**. And it offers easy access to **extend them freely** based on users' need.

## 🛠️ Installation

Install python packages

```
python -m venv venv_name && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set environment variables:

This project uses the python-dotenv library to manage environment variables. Please create a `.env` file to store sensitive information such as your Hugging Face token and OpenAI API key. These variables will be automatically loaded using load_dotenv().

## 🔍 Answering and Evaluation
If you want to evaluate a specified combination of parameters (including Tasks, Models, Prompt Strategies, Serialization Formats, and Difficulty), you can simply run: (**It will load the dataset directly from the HF repo if you haven't done so**)

```
python main.py
```

The default parameters are “Llama3.1”, “easy”, “LTM”, “Adjacency Set”, “cycle”. 

To run an evaluation on a specific parameter combination (model, difficulty, prompt, serialization format, task), use: 

```
python main.py --model Llama3.1  --mode easy --prompt LTM  --graph_representation 'Adjacency Set' --task cycle
```

Use --task all to evaluate all six tasks with a single model, such as 
```
python main.py --model Llama3.1  --task all
```

Results are saved in the following directories:

```
└── results
    ├── agg_jsonfile 
    │   ├── load_bfsorder.json
        ├── load_connectivity.json
        ...
    ├── im_jsonfile
    │   ├── bfsorder
        ├── connectivity
        ...
 ```
Each combination will be saved in the folder corresponding to `im_jsonfile`, and the result of the integration will be saved in the JSON file corresponding to the task in `agg_jsonfile`.


**If you want to use the new LLM model for evaluation, add the new load model and the relevant code for prediction under predict.py**
```
└── openllm
    ├── predict.py
        ...
 ```

### Output file
Each output .json file contains a list of dictionaries, where each entry corresponds to a query instance. Example:

```

        "name-id": "cycle-easy-LTM-Adjacency Set-0",
        "query": "\n Given a graph representation, your task is determining whether the graph has a cycle \nGraph: Adjacency Set is \n{1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, 3: {0, 1, 2}, 2: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, 5: {0, 1, 2}, 0: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, 7: {0, 1, 2}, 6: {0, 1, 2}, 8: {0, 1, 2}, 4: {0, 1, 2}}\n\nQ: Is there a cycle in this graph?\nA: Let's break down this problem:",

## 📁 Data Structure (available at [HF Repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/G-A-I/GraphOmni))
```
└── query
    ├── query_json 
    │   ├── load_bfsorder.json
        ├── load_connectivity.json
    ...
```
The json file is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary, contains the following information. 

    name-id: Unique identifier for the query instance
    
    query: The full input query
    
    gt_answer: Ground-truth answer for the task
    
    model_response: Dictionary of model outputs (initially empty)
    
    prompt_type, task_type, serialization_type: Metadata describing the setup
    
    graph_info: Graph content in Adjacency Matrix format
    
    graph_type: Type or class of the graph
    
    graph_token: Number of tokens in the serialized graph
    
    model_extract: Whether the model output contains an extractable answer (initially empty)

## 🔒 Closed-Source Model Evaluation

In our project, we used batchapi to evaluate some closed-sourced models. The pipeline is as follows:

If you want to evaluate a specified combination of parameters (including Tasks, Models, Prompt Modes, Serialization Formats, and Difficulty), you can simply run  
```
python batchapi_openai_6tasks.py
```
and retrieve it using 
```
python batchapi_openai_6tasks_retrive.py
```

Results are saved in the following directories:
```
└── closedllm
    ├── openailog
    │   ├── batch
        ├── content
        ├── log
```

The results will be in the `./closedllm/openailog/content/`

Then use `python main_closemodel.py --task all` to add the results and evaluate the performance of the closed-source model.

Thank you can evaluate the results via the very first pipeline.
